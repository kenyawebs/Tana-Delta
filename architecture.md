# Kenya Criminal Legal Agent Assistant - System Architecture

## Overview

The Kenya Criminal Legal Agent Assistant is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to provide legal assistance for criminal law cases in Kenya. The system employs a multi-agent AI architecture to process legal queries, generate court-ready documents, and provide accurate legal information to users.

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using a modern JavaScript framework (Next.js) to ensure responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

#### Key Components:

- **Authentication Module**: Handles user login via WhatsApp and admin authentication
- **Query Interface**: Allows users to submit legal queries and upload documents
- **Results Display**: Presents legal information, document generation options, and references
- **Document Upload**: Enables users to upload legal documents for analysis
- **WhatsApp Widget**: Integrates WhatsApp communication directly into the website
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides monitoring and management capabilities for administrators

#### Technology Stack:
- Next.js (React framework)
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- WhatsApp Business API integration
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

### 2. Backend Architecture

The backend employs a modular, agent-based architecture to process legal queries and generate appropriate responses.

#### Agent Components:

1. **Document Processing Agent**
   - Handles OCR for uploaded documents
   - Extracts text from PDFs and images
   - Preprocesses documents for further analysis

2. **Reasoning Agent**
   - Analyzes legal queries using NLP
   - Interprets user questions in legal context
   - Classifies queries into appropriate categories

3. **Research Agent**
   - Searches legal databases and web resources
   - Retrieves relevant legal information
   - Integrates with external legal repositories

4. **Case Law Retrieval Agent**
   - Accesses case precedents from Kenyan legal databases
   - Matches relevant case law to user queries
   - Extracts key legal principles from cases

5. **Storage Agent**
   - Manages database operations
   - Stores user queries and system responses
   - Maintains user history and preferences

6. **Interaction Agent**
   - Handles user communication flow
   - Manages multi-turn conversations
   - Provides contextual responses based on conversation history

#### Technology Stack:
- Node.js/Express.js for API endpoints
- Python for AI/ML components
- MongoDB for document storage
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- WhatsApp Business API for messaging

### 3. Database Architecture

The system uses a hybrid database approach to efficiently store different types of data.

#### PostgreSQL (Structured Data):
- User information and authentication
- Query history and metadata
- System configuration and settings
- API keys and integration data

#### MongoDB (Document Storage):
- Legal documents and case law
- Generated responses and documents
- Unstructured legal data
- Conversation history

### 4. Integration Architecture

The system integrates with several external services to enhance functionality.

#### External Integrations:
- **WhatsApp Business API**: For user communication and notifications
- **Kenya Law Repository**: For accessing legal statutes and case law
- **OCR Services**: For document text extraction
- **AI/ML Models**: For legal reasoning and document generation

### 5. Android App Architecture

The Android app follows a similar architecture to the web application but is optimized for mobile devices.

#### Key Components:
- **Native UI Components**: Optimized for Android devices
- **API Integration**: Connects to the same backend services
- **Offline Capabilities**: Allows basic functionality without internet connection
- **Push Notifications**: Delivers updates and responses via Android notification system

## Data Flow

1. **User Query Submission**:
   - User submits query via web interface or WhatsApp
   - Query is classified and routed to appropriate agents

2. **Query Processing**:
   - Reasoning Agent analyzes query intent
   - Research Agent retrieves relevant information
   - Case Law Agent finds applicable precedents

3. **Response Generation**:
   - System compiles information from various agents
   - Generates structured response with citations
   - Creates legal documents if requested

4. **Delivery and Feedback**:
   - Response delivered via web interface or WhatsApp
   - User feedback collected for system improvement
   - Conversation history stored for context maintenance

## Security Architecture

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Authentication**: Secure WhatsApp-based authentication for users, separate admin authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different system functions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of system activities
- **Data Protection**: Compliance with Kenya Data Protection Act

## Scalability Considerations

- **Microservices Architecture**: Allows independent scaling of different components
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent deployment
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of traffic across multiple instances
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Queue-based processing for resource-intensive tasks

This architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, allowing for future enhancements and extensions as requirements evolve.
