Specifically, a person is guilty of robbery if they steal anything and, at the time of or immediately before or after the theft, uses or threatens to use actual violence against any person or property to obtain or retain the stolen property.

There are two main categories of robbery under Kenyan law:
1. Simple robbery (Section 296(1)): Theft with violence but without aggravating factors
2. Aggravated robbery (Section 296(2)): Robbery with additional serious elements such as being armed with dangerous weapons, being in company with others, or causing grievous harm

The punishment for simple robbery is imprisonment for up to fourteen years, while aggravated robbery carries a minimum sentence of seven years and can extend to life imprisonment.`,

The essential elements of theft under Kenyan law are:
1. Dishonest taking and carrying away
2. Of movable property
3. Without the consent of the owner
4. With the intention to permanently deprive the owner of the property

Theft is distinguished from robbery in that it does not involve the use or threat of violence. The punishment for theft generally depends on the value and nature of the stolen property, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment for up to seven years for general theft (Section 275), and up to ten years for stealing specific types of property (Section 278).`,

2. Assault causing actual bodily harm (Section 251): Any person who commits an assault occasioning actual bodily harm is guilty of a misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for five years.

An assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force to another person without their consent, or attempts or threatens to apply force in circumstances where the threat appears capable of being carried out. Actual bodily harm refers to any hurt or injury that interferes with the health or comfort of the victim, which is more than merely transient or trifling.`,

The term you're inquiring about appears to relate to offenses under the Penal Code (Cap. 63) of Kenya. While I don't have specific information about this particular term, I can provide general guidance on how legal terms are defined and interpreted in the Kenyan legal system.

In Kenya, criminal offenses are primarily defined in the Penal Code, with additional offenses found in various other statutes. The interpretation of these terms is guided by:

1. Statutory definitions provided in the relevant laws
2. Judicial interpretations through case precedents
3. Common law principles where applicable

For a precise definition of this specific term, I would recommend consulting the relevant sections of the Penal Code or seeking advice from a qualified advocate who specializes in criminal law.`,

1. **Republic v Abdalla Wendo & Others (1953)** - This case established the felony murder rule in Kenya, where a death occurring during the commission of a felony can be charged as murder even without specific intent to kill.

2. **Nzoia Sugar Company Ltd v Fungututi [1988] KLR 399** - The court distinguished between murder and manslaughter based on the presence or absence of malice aforethought.

3. **Joseph Mwangi Gitau v Republic [2020] eKLR** - The Court of Appeal clarified that for a murder conviction, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:
   - The death of the deceased occurred
   - The death was caused by an unlawful act or omission on the part of the accused
   - The accused had malice aforethought (intention to cause death or grievous harm)

4. **Francis Karioko Muruatetu & another v Republic [2017] eKLR** - This landmark Supreme Court decision declared the mandatory death sentence for murder unconstitutional, giving judges discretion in sentencing.

These cases demonstrate that Kenyan courts require clear proof of malice aforethought to distinguish murder from manslaughter, and have moved away from mandatory sentencing to allow consideration of mitigating circumstances.`,

2. **Aboud Rogo Mohammed & another v Republic [2011] eKLR** - The court established that the burden of proving compelling reasons to deny bail rests with the prosecution.

3. **Republic v John Mutinda Mutiso [2017] eKLR** - The court outlined factors to consider when determining bail amounts, including the seriousness of the offense, the strength of the prosecution's case, the accused's character and community ties, and the risk of flight.

4. **Samuel Mwangi Ndung'u v Republic [2020] eKLR** - The Court of Appeal clarified that previous convictions alone are not sufficient compelling reasons to deny bail.

5. **Abubakar Ahmed & 12 others v Republic [2018] eKLR** - The court held that stringent bail conditions that effectively amount to a denial of bail are unconstitutional.

These cases demonstrate that Kenyan courts strongly uphold the constitutional right to bail, placing the burden on the prosecution to demonstrate compelling reasons for denial, while also considering factors such as flight risk, witness interference, and public safety.`,
